In this Project I'll be working with a dataset that consists of submissions users made to Hacker News from 2006 to 2015.

Hacker News is a community where users can submit articles, and other users can upvote those articles. The articles with the most upvotes make it to the front page, where they're more visible to the community.

Using Natural Language Processing, I'll use a datapoint in the dataset called Headlines to train a model that will predict the number of votes an article will recieve


Because upvotes are an indicator of popularity, we'll discover which types of articles tend to be the most popular.

I'll:
1. Prepare the data for Natural Language Processing by Tokenizing
2. Train a model with Linear Regression and  RandomForest Regressor Model
3. Measure the accuracy of the model using Root Mean Square Error (rmse) metrics
